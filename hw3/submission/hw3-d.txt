1.Comment on your experience using this DBMS cloud service.

It is convenient to create, open and save new query. Besides, it is easy to create the table and import the data. Third, if we pay more, I can get better computing ability, which is cool.

2.What do you think about the idea of offering a DBMS as a service in a public cloud.

I think this idea is great. Because there are more and more data today, personal computing may not have the ability to deal with a large amount of data. However, DBMS could service provides everyone the ability of deal with big data, which is awesome.
